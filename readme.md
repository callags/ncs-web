Hello and welcome to the github repository of the Network and Computer Security website.

As you can see this programs runs on laravel, a website framework based on the PHP language. 

If you haven't installed laravel on your OS already, you can do so by following the instructions
here at https://laravel.com/docs/5.6#installation.

From what I've read from the installation page of Laravel you can setup everything on Mac and
Linux.
Not sure if there's a way to do it on Windows, but you could look into setting up a virtual 
machine such as Virtualbox or VMWare. For example, I'm using a Debian 9 VM on Virtualbox to host the website for development.

Once you download/clone the project onto your computer you can start the local web server by
entering "php artisan start" in the directory it was copied into.

When you get into tinkering with certain areas of the website, please note the css code that 
creates the look of each page is found in /public/css/app.css and orignates from w3schools.com.
If you want to make any changes to the css you may want to look at w3schools for a reference.
